This allows you to work with multiple people and efficiently/clearly check each others work, add features or complete tasks, and increase communication between collaborators. 
#Forking vs Cloning
2. There are differences between Forking and Cloning in Github.
- When forking, a copy of the original repository is created 
but it remains on your GitHub account.
- Meanwhile, when cloning, the repository makes a copy and is stored onto your local machine.

#Pull Request
1. Creating a pull request allows you to let other collaborators know about changes that you've put on Git.
- This is one of the more important features of Git because it allows others to review your work and see the tasks/features you've completed.
- With this could come merge conflicts. THis can be caused by competing line changes, where 2 or more individuals change the same line on the same file. This can be solved locally.

- On the "Pull Request" list, it will show a "Resolve Conflicts" Tab. Once the conflict is resolved, mark as resolved.
